# Evaluating The Performance of Sentiment Analysis Algorithms and Comparisons with LLMs

The aim of this project was to investigate whether large language models, specifically generative pre-trained transformers models (for e.g., ChatGPT, LLaMA-2), can serve as universal sentiment analysers in our industries. 
I compared the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest models with the LLaMA-2 7 billion parameter model.
A statistical significance test —Mann-Whitney U Test— was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the performance of sentiment analysis algorithms between traditional machine learning models and the LLaMA-2 model.



#### Code and files structure
* There are 5 mains files containing the corresponding code for each model:
    - SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and LLaMA

* The datasets used are: Twitter US Airline Sentiment and IMDb Movie Review

* The folders in the directory contain graphs for each model, as well as statistical tests.
